| 1 | 4 | good version of a classic | This is a charming version of the classic Dicken's tale. Henry Winkler makes a good showing as the "Scrooge" character. Even though you know what will happen this version has enough of a change to make it better that average. If you love A Christmas Carol in any version, then you will love this. |
| 2 | 3 | Good but not as moving | It was good but not as emotionally moving as the the Christmas Carol by Dickens I like Christmas movies that make me sigh |
| 3 | 3 | Winkler's Performance was ok at best! | Don't get me wrong, Winkler is a wonderful character actor and I would rate 95% of his performances as B+ or A, however, he was not very convincing in the starring role of "An American Christmas Carol." I'd give it a C or C+ at best. Ayyyyy! |
